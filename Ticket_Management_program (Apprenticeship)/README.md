# Ticket Management Program:

This application was developed for my First year Software Engineering Fundamanetals Module.

## Requirements:

### Python:
Python Version: 3.12.1 or above
If you use any older python version the program will not work and instead crash due to it requiring features that are only in the newer versions

### Modules:
<a href="https://pypi.org/project/cryptography/" target="_blank">Cryptography</a> (<code>pip install cryptography</code>)<br><br>
<a href="https://docs.pytest.org/en/8.0.x/" target="_blank">PyTest</a> ((Optional) only required if you plan on running the tests.)

### Operating System:

Windows: 64bit that supports the required python version

Linux: any 64bit Distro that supports the required python version (raspberry PI's included)

MacOS: unknown, assumption is that it works on there


## How to run:

To run the program makesure that all of the requirements are satisified and then run the Script `Start_here.py`.

If the program works correctly you should then find yourself at the programs main menu.

There is a user login system in the program which requires the inputting of a username and password which are:<br>
`Username:` `Admin`<br>
`Password:` `Admin`<br>
Please note there is an issue that I haven't fixed where sometimes it will get you to enter the username and password twice.
